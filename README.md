# Statistics
Project Name: Statistical Analysis Tool

Description:
This C code represents a Statistical Analysis Tool designed to empower users to perform a wide range of statistical computations on datasets comprised of real numbers. This tool facilitates the computation of essential statistical metrics, such as the mean, median, range, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation, enabling users to gain valuable insights from their data. Additionally, it offers the capability to generate both frequency tables and histograms, aiding in the visualization of data distributions.

What I Have Learned:
Through the development and exploration of this project, I have acquired a profound understanding of fundamental statistical concepts and their practical implementation. I have learned:

1. Statistical Computation: I have gained the ability to calculate key statistical metrics, including the mean, median, range, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation. This knowledge allows me to uncover important insights within datasets.
2. Sorting Algorithms: I have acquired proficiency in sorting algorithms, particularly the merge sort algorithm, which is crucial for data processing and analysis.
3. Data Visualization: I have learned how to create frequency tables and histograms, which are powerful tools for visualizing data distributions and patterns.
4. Logarithmic Transformations: I am now familiar with the concept of logarithmic transformations, which can be applied to data to facilitate specific types of analysis.
5. File Handling: I have learned how to read data from files and process it efficiently, enhancing my data processing capabilities.

This tool holds great utility for individuals engaged in data analysis, research, or any field that demands statistical data processing. It equips users with the means to swiftly obtain valuable statistical insights and present data distributions visually.

Please feel free to utilize and adapt this tool to suit your unique data analysis requirements.
